Group # 4 Multi-Bot Controlle----------------------------
• Windows/Linux machine. 

• ATmega2560 micro-controller provides the platform for programming the FireBird V robot [1][2] to perform speci?c tasks. 

• ZigBee [3] chip must be con?gured on the robots to enable wireless communication with the central controller, where broadcast mode is used at the controller-side. 

• Serial COM port helps send data (i.e. traversal path in the form of commands) or receive data (acknowledgement for task completion) to the ZigBee protocol for communication between the central controller and robots. 

• White line Sensors help in path navigation within the GH model arena.
